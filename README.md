## 📖 About The Project (Me)

I am a **complex systems analyst** by nature, transitioning from political advocacy to **Data Engineering**.

My background in political analysis (City of Brussels, CIEP-MOC) taught me how to translate on-the-ground realities into clear frameworks. Now, I am pivoting to translate those frameworks into **robust code architectures**.

> **Mission:** To acquire the quantitative mastery necessary to "humanize tech" and guarantee data quality for societal analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Foundations

I have built a solid foundation through self-study and certifications.

| Category | Skills | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Languages** | 🐍 Python, ☕ Java | 
| **Architecture** | 🗺️ [BPMN (Business Process Mapping)](https://academy.gbtec.com/certificates/qboikystzi) | 
| **Data/AI** | 🤖 [Supervised Machine Learning (Stanford)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/KBL1ISLB5JJ) |

## 🚀 Why BeCode?

While I have self-studied the *syntax*, I need BeCode's immersive environment to master the *practice*.

* **Pedagogy:** The "Active Learning" model fits my autodidact nature (Resource/Fire profile).

* **Environment:** I thrive in collaborative, *Solution Mindset* environments where failure is part of the debugging process.

* **Goal:** To move from "knowing code" to **building work-ready data pipelines**.

## 🧬 Soft Skills Integration

My previous experience leading demanding projects and facilitating working groups is my "hidden code":

* **Systems Thinking:** Aligning strict processes on gender equality with European frameworks at Chaska for the City of Brusseks (perfect for Pipelines).

* **Communication:** Translating "Black Box" algorithms for non-technical audiences during a citizenship course at Bruxelles Formation (perfect for Data Storytelling).

* **Resilience:** Managing a database, data cleaning and preparation with Excel at Women Political Leaders (perfect for Data Cleaning).
